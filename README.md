# Call of Cthulhu Card Game #

This is a Call of Cthulhu card game implemented with pygame.

It's unfinished, so far the game works with the main rules based on card attributes, however the special rules based on each card's text remains to be implemented. Since development did not finish (and most likely never will), it runs in demo mode by default, where two players controlled by AI are making the moves (and extensive logs detailing the player decisions and the progression of the game based on rules are spitted out).

### Demo ###

To watch the interactive demo of two AI players playing with a random
deck each, clone the repo and run the demo script.

```
git clone git@github.com:frrmack/CallofCthulhu.git

Note that there are resolution, fullscreen/window, and background
image settings within run_demo.py that you can manually change before
running it.
